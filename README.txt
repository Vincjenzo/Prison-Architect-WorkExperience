This script generates a HTML file, that provides an overview of all prisoners and their work experience, drug/alcohol addictions, and the amount of time served inside the prison.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
To run this script you need to install PHP (http://php.net),
Then EDIT the script and CHANGE the $save_file variable at the start of the script.
Then execute the script (see usage_example.png or this example with full paths): 
C:\Users\Vincent>c:\xampp\php\php.exe C:\users\Vincent\script.php > C:\users\Vincent\output.html
(php interpreter, php script, > redirects output, .html file to put the output)
Then open output.html in a webbrowser. See screenshot output_example.png.

WHY?
The game currently does not support adding a custom report like this, (or I don't know how..) and this 'report' does provide me with the data to manage work experience in a better way, instead of constantly checking each individual prisoner (so tedious).
